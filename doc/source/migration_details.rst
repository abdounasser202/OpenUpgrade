Running the migration
=====================

Check out the code manually and upgrade your database by calling odoo-bin,
(or openerp-server) directly. You will want to do this when you are working on
developing migration scripts for uncovered modules.

1. Make the `openupgrade_framework` and the `openupgrade_scripts` modules
   available in the addons path in the Odoo instance of the new version.

   Or, for older versions: check out the OpenUpgrade source code from Github
   for the branches you need. Each branch migrates to its version from the
   previous version, so branch 13.0 migrates from 12.0 to 13.0. If you are
   migrating across multiple versions, you need to run each version of
   OpenUpgrade in order. Skipping versions is not supported.

2. Check if there are migration scripts provided for the set of modules that
   are installed in your Odoo database. If there are modules for which no
   migration scripts have been developed yet, your migration may fail or the
   integrity of your database may me lacking. Check the module coverage in
   this documentation.

3. Decide which database you are going to upgrade. You absolutely *must* make a
   backup of your live database before you start this process!

4. Edit the configuration files and command line parameters to point to the
   database you are going to upgrade. Run Odoo with the *--update all
   --stop-after-init --load=web,openupgrade_framework* flags.

   For versions earlier than 14.0 that are running the OpenUpgrade fork rather
   than Odoo itself, you do not pass the `load` parameter.

5. Run the upgrade and check for errors. You will probably learn a lot about
   your data and have to do some manual clean up before and after the upgrade.
   Expect to repeat the process several times as you encounter errors, clean up
   your data, and try again. If necessary, ask for help or report bugs on
   Github.

General Tips
++++++++++++

* When installing the openupgradelib make sure you check out the latest version
  from github to get the latest updates and fixes::

    $ pip install git+git://github.com/OCA/openupgradelib.git

Configuration options (deprecated)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Versions of OpenUpgrade earlier than 14.0 allow for the following configuration
options. Add these options to a separate stanza in the server configuration
file under a header *[openupgrade]*

* *autoinstall* - A dictionary with module name keys and lists of module names
  as values. If a key module is installed on your database, the modules from
  the value (and their dependencies) are selected for installation as well.

* *force_deps* - A dictionary with module name keys and lists of module names
  as values. If a key module is installed on your database, the modules from
  the value will be treated as a module dependency. With this directive, you
  can manipulate the order in which the modules are migrated. If the modules
  from the value are not already installed on your database, they will be
  selected for installation (as will their dependencies). Be careful not to
  introduce a circular dependency using this directive.
